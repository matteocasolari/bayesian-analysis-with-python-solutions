# Solutions to Programming Exercises for *Bayesian Analysis with Python (3rd Edition)*

## About  
This repository contains solutions to the programming exercises from [*Bayesian Analysis with Python - Third Edition*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1805127160) by Osvaldo Martin (Packt Publishing, 2024). The book introduces Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming using Python, focusing on PyMC, ArviZ, and other essential libraries.

## Environment Setup  

To set up the Python environment and install dependencies using Conda, follow these steps:  

### 1. Create a Conda Environment  
Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:  

```bash
conda create --name bayesian-analysis-with-python python=3.10
```

Activate the environment:  

```bash
conda activate bayesian-analysis-with-python
```

### 2. Install Dependencies  
Once the environment is activated, install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation  
Check if the dependencies are installed correctly:  

```bash
pip list
```

Now you're ready to run the solutions! ðŸš€
